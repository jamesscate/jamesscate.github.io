## Introduction to FPKI Guides

Federal Public Key Infrastructure (FPKI) provides the government with a common infrastructure to administer digital certificates and public-private key pairs, including the ability to issue, maintain, and revoke public key certificates. FPKI leverages a security technique called Public Key Cryptography to authenticate users and data, protect the integrity of transmitted data, and ensure non-repudiation and confidentiality. 

Components of FPKI include the Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA) and the Federal PKI Common Policy Framework (FCPCA). The Federal PKI Policy Authority (FPKIPA) and the Federal PKI Management Authority (FPKIMA) are the Federal Trust Framework governance bodies for PKI credentials and support an environment of trust between different organizations' PKI credentials.
